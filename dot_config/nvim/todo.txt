- migrate to lazy.nvim? PackerSync is awful on windws
- consider persistence.nvim for session management
- improve cmd generator to prune off .core, .application, .infrastructure, and .tests -- necessary?
- get rid of hardcoded sln selection logic
	- default to sln selection menu if not found
- diagnose diagnostics
- create custom fidget for omnisharp, given that it doesn't dispatch events that fidget understands
- rename is_unix to is_osx and add an is_linux bool as well as the appropriate conditionals
- test on
	- equipmentdomain
	- external retail api (despite deprecation)
	- sqlscripts
	- QRCodeAPI
	- commerce.client
	- equipment-support
	- retail payment
	- retail shopping
	- observation api/client
- see if i can get rust to update diagnostics on change instead of save. in the meantime, hide diagnostics until save
- investigate input latency in noice.nvim
- vim split shortcuts

larger projects:
- massive reorganization
- tmux passthrough ctrl-a for vim panes
	- vim-tpipeline?
- replace arch with alpine if i'm only using it for tmux, otherwise consider going full WSL (again)
	- We're finally on 19044+!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GUI WSL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
