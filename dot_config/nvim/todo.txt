- session management is a shit show, remove it until further notice -- try nvim-possession and maybe contribute to it for autostart
- improve cmd generator to prune off .core, .application, .infrastructure, and .tests -- necessary?
- get rid of hardcoded sln selection logic
	- default to sln selection menu if not found
- diagnose diagnostics
- create custom fidget for omnisharp, given that it doesn't dispatch events that fidget understands
- move monitor
- rename is_unix to is_osx and add an is_linux bool as well as the appropriate conditionals
- test on
	- equipmentdomain
	- external retail api (despite deprecation)
	- sqlscripts
	- QRCodeAPI
	- commerce.client
	- equipment-support
	- retail payment
	- retail shopping
	- observation api/client
- see if i can get rust to update diagnostics on change instead of save. in the meantime, hide diagnostics until save
larger projects:
- massive reorganization
- tmux passthrough ctrl-a for vim panes
- replace arch with alpine if i'm only using it for tmux, otherwise consider going full WSL (again)
- org mode analog
	- neorg?
	- orgmode.nvim
	- vimwiki + taskwiki
