- CREATE A TOGGLE SYSTEM TO QUICKY SWITCH AMONG OMNISHARP, CSHARP-LS, and OMNISHARP-VIM
- consider giving up on fully native lsp for csharp and going with omnisharp-vim and some sort of bridge to the lsp -- null-ls.nvim?
- dig into csharp-ls source code to determine what SDKs are used to load which projects 
- weird problem: go to definition with csharp-ls opens definition in a new readonly buffer
- add nvim-treesitter-context
- session management is a shit show, remove it until further notice -- try nvim-possession

larger projects:
- make it possible to update kickstart base config direct from github without losing my changes
				- try to get changes out of kickstart and into custom files
				- address redundancy in vim.opts in defaults.lua vs init.lua
				- consider contributing to quickstart: treesitter config should optionally import an override config if it exists
- tmux passthrough ctrl-a for vim panes
- org mode
	- neorg?
