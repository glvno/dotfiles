larger projects:
- make it possible to update kickstart base config direct from github without losing my changes
				- try to get changes out of kickstart and into custom files
				- address redundancy in vim.opts in defaults.lua vs init.lua
				- consider contributing to quickstart: treesitter config should optionally import an override config if it exists
- track dotfiles with chez moi
				- delete .omnisharp roslyn config and see what happens, if necessary, track with chezmoi
				- track iterm config in chezmoi
- conditional configuration by OS: node provider, omnisharp binary
- tmux passthrough ctrl-a for vim panes
- org mode
	- neorg?
