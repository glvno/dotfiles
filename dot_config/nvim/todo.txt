- session management is a shit show, remove it until further notice -- try nvim-possession
- improve cmd generator to prune off .core, .application, .infrastructure, and .tests -- necessary?
- get chezmoi auto pushing and pulling
- get rid of hardcoded sln selection logic
	- default to sln selection menu if not found
