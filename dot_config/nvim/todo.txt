- session management is a shit show, remove it until further notice -- try nvim-possession
- improve cmd generator to prune off .core, .application, .infrastructure, and .tests -- necessary?
- get rid of hardcoded sln selection logic
	- default to sln selection menu if not found
- diagnose diagnostics
- create custom fidget for omnisharp, given that it doesn't dispatch events that fidget understands
- move monitor

larger projects:
- massive reorganization
- tmux passthrough ctrl-a for vim panes
- org mode
	- neorg?
