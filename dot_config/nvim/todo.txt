- CREATE A TOGGLE SYSTEM TO QUICKY SWITCH AMONG OMNISHARP, CSHARP-LS, and OMNISHARP-VIM
- session management is a shit show, remove it until further notice -- try nvim-possession
- improve cmd generator to prune off .core, .application, .infrastructure, and .tests -- necessary?

larger projects:
- make it possible to update kickstart base config direct from github without losing my changes
				- try to get changes out of kickstart and into custom files
				- address redundancy in vim.opts in defaults.lua vs init.lua
				- consider contributing to quickstart: treesitter config should optionally import an override config if it exists
- tmux passthrough ctrl-a for vim panes
- org mode
	- neorg?
